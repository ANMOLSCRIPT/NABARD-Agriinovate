## Overview
Agrosaarathi is a platform designed to empower farmers with real-time market information, price trends, and tools to negotiate better deals. Our project includes a mobile app, a website, a chatbot, and USSD services to provide accessible and transparent market data to farmers. This will allow us to connect farmers and buyers. As per the problem statement we have made our platform transparent with transaction history and the ability to pay through the website and app itself. Through our platform, we have connected all the stakeholders in the agriculture value chain, including banks, buyers, consultants, and communities of farmers, by means of a community chat function.
